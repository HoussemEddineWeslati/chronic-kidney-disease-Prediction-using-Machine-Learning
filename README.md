  <h1  align="left">Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction with Machine Learning</h1>

  <h2  align="left">Project Overview</h2>
  <p  align="left">Welcome to the Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction project! The primary objective of this project is to develop effective tools for predicting the occurrence of chronic kidney disease using machine learning techniques.</p>

  <h2  align="left">Methodology</h2>
    <p  align="left">The approach followed in this project involved several key steps:</p>

  <h3  align="left">1. Class Balancing</h3>
    <p  align="left">To address the non-uniform distribution of instances in the two classes (presence and absence of chronic kidney disease), we applied class balancing techniques. This step was crucial to ensure that the machine learning models didn't become biased towards the majority class.</p>

  <h3  align="left">2. Feature Ranking and Analysis</h3>
    <p  align="left">Feature selection is a critical part of model development. We conducted feature ranking and analysis to identify the most informative features that would contribute significantly to the prediction of chronic kidney disease.</p>

  <h3  align="left">3. Machine Learning Models</h3>
    <p  align="left">We trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including:</p>
    <ul  align="left">
        <li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> Techniques for extracting relevant information from the dataset.</li>
        <li><strong>Standardization:</strong> Ensuring all features are on the same scale for better model performance.</li>
        <li><strong>AdaBoost:</strong> Employing AdaBoost, an ensemble learning method, to improve model accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Recursive Feature Elimination:</strong> Iteratively selecting the most important features to optimize the model.</li>
        <li><strong>Grid Search:</strong> Tuning hyperparameters using grid search to find the best model configuration.</li>
    </ul>
    <p  align="left">These techniques were carefully employed to enhance the predictive accuracy and efficiency of the models.</p>
